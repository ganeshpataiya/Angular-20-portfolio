        About
    </h4>

    <p class='mb-5'>I'm a developer passionate about creating accessible, pixel-perfect user interfaces that seamlessly
        blend thoughtful design with robust engineering. I excel at the intersection of design and development, crafting
        experiences that not only look great but are meticulously built for performance and usability.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, I serve as a principal consultant at Genpact, specializing in accessibility. My responsibilities
        include developing reusable user interface (UI) components and markups, building pages using these components,
        and creating and reviewing tasks for the team. I maintain and enhance the UI library for current and future
        projects, share new release notes with all project managers regarding new UI components, and work closely with
        project managers on new requirements. I utilize common front-end development tools such as Webpack, NPM, and use
        Git for version control, regularly pushing code to GitHub. I participate in day-to-day meetings and workshops,
        status meetings, as part of agile methodology and scrum process.
    </p>
    <p>
        I develop multiple user interfaces for different projects of Genpact clients and Utilize React JS to create
        dynamic and interactive custom blocks for Drupal/WordPress. React's component-based architecture allows for
        efficient rendering and state management within <a href='https://drupalgutenberg.org/demo' target='_blank'

    </p>


    <p class='mb-5'>In the past, I've collaborated with internal and external stakeholders to discover, build, improve,
        and expand the user experience. I have a proven history of creating cutting-edge interface designs and
        information architectures for websites and mobile applications through a user-centered design process by
        constructing screen flows, prototypes, and wireframes.</p>
    <p>In my spare time, I enjoy photography, gardening, and spending quality time with my family.</p>
